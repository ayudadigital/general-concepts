## Introduction

A set of activities, techniques, strategies, services, processes and tools related to the creation and operation of all aspects of an application. The greater the scope of the software project we are immersed in, the more people are involved in it and more important is the concept of the _Lifecycle_.

We know that _development_ is supposed to be the primary activity, but it's not the only one: we can extend the _Lifecycle_ to other activities, including those beyond the point of production, adding metrics and alarms in the production environment, with _feedback loops_ that originate in maintenance tasks, support or new features and that imply modifications of the source code that take us [back to the beginning](#introducci√≥n).

It is common to find the concept of the _Lifecycle_ associated with a series of steps executed in order: analysis, design, development, testing, integration, deployment. Or perhaps to an _iterative and incremental_ process with stages that are repeated over and over again.

From this perspective, if we use services (for example, Jenkins), its installation, configuration, deployment, maintenance and operation is also part of the _Lifecycle_, as well as the rest of the tools, services, activities, techniques, strategies and processes.
